# Calculator

This little silly project was made with CSS, jQuery and of course, love and care. It is a very basic app. The example showcases the great power of the new CSS3 specifications. Actually, the only image that I used for this UI design is the background grain image.

It's so cool what you can do with CSS3 these days!

At this point, the jQuery simply handles the event of clicking the buttons in the UI, forming a string containing everything the user is clicking. Please refer to Bugs/Future Features for more.

##Advantages
1. Minimal code for the UI (only CSS)
2. Minimum usage of images and photoshop templates etc.
3. More flexible while designing to the detail

##Bugs/Future features
1. Somewhat dirty/non-optimized code
2. Calculate function will actually work in the future
